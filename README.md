### Report on Logistic Regression Analysis of Social Network Ads Data

*** Introduction:

The objective of this report is to analyze the Social Network Ads dataset using logistic regression to predict whether a user purchased a product based on 
their age and estimated salary. This analysis involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

*** Data Exploration and Preparation:

1. **Dataset Overview**:
   - The dataset (`Social_Network_Ads.csv`) contains information about users including `Age`, `EstimatedSalary`, `Gender`, `User ID`, and `Purchased`.
   - Initial exploration shows no missing values and provides a summary of statistical measures for numeric columns (`Age`, `EstimatedSalary`, `Purchased`).

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Scatter plots were used to visualize relationships between `Age` and `EstimatedSalary`, colored by whether the user `Purchased` the product. This helps
     understand potential separability of classes based on these features.

*** Model Building and Evaluation:

1. **Feature Selection**:
   - Features `Age` and `EstimatedSalary` were selected as predictors (`x`), and `Purchased` was the target variable (`y`).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - `Gender` and `User ID` columns were dropped as they are not relevant for predictive modeling.
   - The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.
   - Features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Logistic regression was chosen as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification tasks.
   - The model was trained on the standardized training data (`X_train`, `y_train`).

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Predictions were made on the testing data (`X_test`) using the trained logistic regression model.
   - The accuracy score and confusion matrix were calculated to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   - The confusion matrix and accuracy score provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify users who purchased the product.

*** Results and Visualizations:

1. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - The confusion matrix visually represents the performance of the logistic regression model on the testing data.
   - It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.

2. **Decision Boundaries**:
   - Decision boundary plots were generated to visualize how the logistic regression model separates the classes (`Purchased = 0` and `Purchased = 1`)
     based on `Age` and `EstimatedSalary`.
   - These plots help understand the model's classification boundaries and how well it generalizes to new data.

*** Conclusion:

In conclusion, the logistic regression model trained on the Social Network Ads dataset demonstrates reasonable predictive performance for predicting user 
purchases based on `Age` and `EstimatedSalary`. The accuracy score and visualizations provide insights into the model's behavior and effectiveness. Further 
enhancements could involve feature engineering or exploring other classification algorithms to potentially improve model performance.

Overall, this analysis showcases the application of logistic regression for binary classification tasks and highlights its utility in predicting consumer 
behavior based on demographic information.
